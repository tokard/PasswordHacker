# PasswordHacker
All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners – and hackers. In this project you’ll wear the hat of a real hacker. You must connect to a secret server without knowing the password. Your task is to write a Python program that can hack this password, and do so in the quickest way possible.
You will learn how hacking works. You will work with iterators and generators, and you’ll learn a little something about the itertools module – one of the most powerful features of Python. You will practice developing a client app and connecting to a server using the socket module. The project will also get you acquainted with JSON and the time module.
